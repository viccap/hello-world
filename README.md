# hello-world
my first git-hub repository for mr to create projects and understand how everything works :)


im exited to see if ill be able to use this for future Projects! Today is December 6th 2020 and I can't wait to learn more about coding!
Git-hub seems interesting but I still haven't really understood it.

anyway, I'm interested to see where this goes :)
